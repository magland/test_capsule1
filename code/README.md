# Interactive demonstration of plateau-generating mechanisms in temporal order judgments (TOJs)

This capsule provides an interactive demonstration of plateau-generating mechanisms in temporal order judgments (TOJs) to accompany our publication "Stuck on a Plateau? A Model-Based Approach to Fundamental Issues in Visual Temporal-Order Judgments" (preprint available [1]). The TVA-reset model (also cf. [2]) assumes a processing reset when the second stimulus is presented in brief succession after the first stimulus (assumed to equal TVA's [3] t0 parameter). For simulating TOJs with TVA in general, see [4]. The range of indecision model was proposed by [5].

## Paramters

TVA parameters can be set in the user interface. The descriptions refer to "TVA-reset" or "RoI" (range of indecision) to indicate to which model the parameter belongs.

SOAs can be changed directly in the code.
