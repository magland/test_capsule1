name: Interactive demonstration of plateau-generating mechanisms in temporal order
  judgments (TOJs)
description: This capsule provides an interactive demonstration of plateau-generating
  mechanisms in temporal order judgments (TOJs) to accompany our publication &#34;Stuck
  on a Plateau? A Model-Based Approach to Fundamental Issues in Visual Temporal-Order
  Judgments&#34;. The TVA-reset model assumes a processing reset when the second stimulus
  is presented in brief succession after the first stimulus (assumed to equal TVA&#39;s
  t0 parameter). The alternative range of indecision model was proposed by García-Pérez
  &amp; Alcalá-Quintana.
